# OCR-Based Mobile Number Extractor  

This project is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model designed to extract mobile numbers from various file types, including images, PDFs, and documents. The model leverages EasyOCR for text recognition and processing. It is optimized for typed numbers and includes improvements for recognizing handwritten numbers.

---

 Features  
âœ… Extracts mobile numbers from:  
- Images (JPG, PNG, BMP)  
- PDFs  
- Text Documents (DOC, DOCX)  

âœ… Handles different number formats and patterns  
âœ… High accuracy for typed numbers  
âœ… Basic support for handwritten numbers  
âœ… Fast and efficient processing

 Technologies Used  
- Python â€“ Core programming language  
- EasyOCR â€“ Optical character recognition  
- OpenCV â€“ Image processing  
- PyMuPDF â€“ PDF parsing  
- Docx â€“ Document parsing
